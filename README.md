# Hand-Gesture-Volume-Control

In this project, we created a system that uses hand gestures to control the volume of your computer. By using a camera to watch your hand movements, the system detects when you move your thumb and index finger closer or further apart. Based on this hand gesture, it adjusts the volume up or down. We also added a visual bar on the screen that shows the current volume level, so you can see how loud or quiet the sound is. The whole process is designed to be intuitive and allows you to control the volume just by moving your hand.
